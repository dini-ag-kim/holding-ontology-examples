Provided examples are created with [easyM2R](https://github.com/cKlee/easyM2R).

The MARC 21 data source is taken from the raw MARC 21 file [**`test_hld_10.mrc`**](test_hld_10.mrc) or from the text file [**`test_hld_10.txt`**](test_hld_10.txt).

The JSON-LD based mapping for easyM2R can be found in the file [**`zdb-holding.jsonld`**](zdb-holding.jsonld).
